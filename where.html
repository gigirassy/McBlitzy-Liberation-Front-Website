<h1>how do i get mcblitzy?</h1>
<p>this toy, while rare in the us, can be found easily on french used goods sites, making them a valued option if you're willing to get someone to forward. (or if you have a seller kind enough) there are people who can do that, as well as forwarding sites.</p>
<p><details><summary>french marketplaces</summary>
<a href="https://vinted.fr">vinted</a> (french items might ship to other places in europe. the toy is most plentiful here)<br>
<a href="https://www.leboncoin.fr/">leboncoin</a> (works more like facebook marketplace, only for france)<br>
<a href="https://fr.shopping.rakuten.com/">rakuten france</a> (ships to canada as well)

<p>mcdo, mac, mcdonald's, mac donald's, 2008, transformers, blitzwing, tank, happy meal</p>
<p>tip: a lot of sellers might not know what character the toy is or what transformers franchise its from, so you might not find much by searching up "transformers animated" or "blitzwing". more generic terms like "mac do" (french slang term), "transformer(s)", and "happy meal" might help.</p>
